## Visualization 1 - Broadband Infrastructure and Foreign Direct Investment in the Carribean

### Purpose

The purpose of this visualization is to demonstrate the benefit of net foreign direct investment (FDI) in expanding access to broadband internet in the Caribbean. Specifically, I am exploring the relationship between FDI net inflow and broadband access[^1] from  2013-2023 with respect to the World Bank's definition of Caribbean Small States and Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[^2]

I have omitted larger Caribbean states such as Jamaica and Cuba as well as non-sovereign overseas territories and provinces due to extreme outliers. I have also omitted some points due to overlap, as some years had extremely similar yearly FDI inflow values. I do not expect these adjustments to misrepresent the data. Importantly, I want the end user to observe the stark difference between Haiti and the Dominican Republic despite being neighbors on the same island.  

[^1]: Fixed broadband subscriptions refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-to-the-home/building, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. It *excludes* subscriptions that have access to data communications via mobile-cellular networks.

[^2]:The Caribbean Small States are Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname.

## Visualization 2 - Japan's railroad infrastructure and its relationship with Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP)

### Purpose 

The purpose behind this visualization is to emphasis how railroad investment contributes to economic success. Japan has an extensive network of both private and government-owned railroads[^3] that efficiently ships foreign imports from the major ports of Japan and ferry commuters between the office and their home. Japan's high-speed rail systemâ€”the *shinkansen*, is vaunted for its ability to travel between major cities while maintaining superb passenger comfort and boosting regional economic growth.[^4]

## Visualization 3: One 'Rail' to Rule Them All: MTA Domination: 2002 - 2023

## Original Visualization 4 - 'Debt and Taxes': The Two Guarantees of Public Transportation

### Purpose

The purpose behind this visualization is to cement the point that public, government-operated transport is often run at a loss in metropolitan areasâ€”especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. On one hand, the business model of government-run public transport is what keeps *all* the citizens on major metropolitan areas moving and reduces the amount of cars of the street. On the other hand, the troubling lack of investment in public transportation in addition to increasing expenses continues to hamper the safety, resilience, and existence of public transport. 

Notably, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority leads the pack in debt with over $200 million dollars.[^5] This hits close to home, as Iâ€”as well as hundreds of thousands of other peopleâ€”rely on WMATA to visit Northern Virginia and Maryland.
